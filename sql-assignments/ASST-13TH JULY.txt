SELECT * FROM SalesLT.Product p 
1) What is the Name, ProductID and Weight for the item with Product Number 'RM-M823'

SELECT P.Name,P.ProductID,P.Weight
FROM SalesLT.Product p
WHERE P.ProductNumber = 'RM-M823'

2) List products with weight greater than 500. For those products, show the following information: Product ID, Name, ListPrice 
    and calculated Gross Margin (difference between list price and standard cost)
 
SELECT P.Name,P.ProductID,P.ListPrice ,( p.ListPrice - p.StandardCost) AS  GrossMargin
FROM SalesLT.Product p
WHERE P.Weight> 500

3)How many Products are there with the standard weight between 400 and 500
 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 
(
	SELECT P.ProductID
	FROM SalesLT.Product p
	WHERE P.Weight BETWEEN 400 AND 500
	GROUP BY P.ProductID ) T

4)How many Yellow colored bikes are there (Bikes can be identified by the Product number starting with 'BK')

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM SalesLT.Product P
WHERE P.ProductNumber LIKE 'BK%' AND P.Color = 'Yellow'

5) Find average, maximum and minimum list price for each Product line (exclude products where Product line is NULL),
sort descending by Average Standard Cost.

SELECT SUBSTRING(P.ProductNumber,1,2) AS ProductLine, AVG(P.ListPrice) AS AVG,MAX(P.ListPrice) AS MAX ,MIN(P.ListPrice) AS MIN
FROM SalesLT.Product P
WHERE SUBSTRING(P.ProductNumber,1,2) IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY SUBSTRING(P.ProductNumber,1,2)
ORDER BY AVG(StandardCost) DESC
